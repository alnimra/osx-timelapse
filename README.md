osx-timelapse
=============

This project is a series of quick Mac OSX shell scripts I put together for taking timed screenshots and iSight snapshots.

It was put together for use in the Ludum Dare challenge in order to capture a timelapse of my development.

I've only tested these on my Mac, which is currently:

- Macbook Pro (Early 2011)
- 8 Gb RAM
- Mac OSX Lion v10.8.3

Use at your own risk. The License is WTFPL (see LICENSE.txt).

There were several references I used to put this together and they all deserve the credit for helping me to essentially compile this little package together.
